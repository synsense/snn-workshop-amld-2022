# ANN to SNN conversion for spiking computer vision

In this tutorial we will train a CNN on a body posture classification task with 5 different postures. Then we'll convert that model to an SNN, so that we can deploy it on our neuromorphic hardware!


1. Introduction about the task / dataset
2. Open the exercise script on Google Colab and figure out how to train the CNN on the data provided. Convert the CNN to an SNN using the code provided and save model once you're finished.
4. [Upload](https://www.dropbox.com/request/uwBr6x2kkuV9hC15xNSX) your model to Dropbox so that we can deploy it on a Speck chip!
