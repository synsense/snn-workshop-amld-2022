# ANN to SNN conversion for spiking computer vision

In this small tutorial we will train a CNN on a body posture classification task with 5 different postures. Then we'll convert that model to an SNN, so that we can deploy it on our neuromorphic hardware!

1. Introduction about the task / dataset
2. Open the training script on Google Colab and figure out how to train the CNN on the data provided. Save model once you're finished.
3. Convert the CNN to an SNN using the script provided.
4. Come see one of us with your saved model so that we can deploy it on a Speck chip!
