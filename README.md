# Spiking Neural Networks for Low-Power Real-Time Inference @ Applied Machine Learning Days 2022

This repository contains materials for the [AMLD2022 workshop](https://appliedmldays.org/events/amld-epfl-2022/workshops/spiking-neural-networks-for-low-power-real-time-inference) on using SNNs for low-power, real-time inference tasks.
It is grouped into 4 sections:

1. General introduction to spiking neural networks and what we do at @SynSense
2. ANN to SNN conversion for spiking computer vision
3. Training SNNs from scratch
4. Audio processing


## The team at the workshop

Sadique Sheik, Felix Bauer, Philipp Weidel, Hannah Bos, Saeid Haghighatshoar, Nogay Küpelioğlu, Mina Khoei and Gregor Lenz. You can contact us at <name.surname@synsense.ai>
